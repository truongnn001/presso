/*
 * PressO Desktop - Orchestration Kernel
 * ======================================
 * 
 * Build Tool: Gradle (Kotlin DSL)
 * Justification:
 *   - Gradle provides better flexibility for polyglot projects
 *   - Kotlin DSL offers type-safe build scripts with IDE support
 *   - Superior dependency management for desktop applications
 *   - Better suited for packaging as single JAR (fat/shadow JAR)
 *   - Native support for subprocess management in tests
 * 
 * Reference: PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md Section 8.1
